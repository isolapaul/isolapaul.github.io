Place the SpotOn screenshot here as `spoton.png`.

- Filename: `spoton.png`
- Path: `assets/spoton.png`

If you want me to add the FaceRecognitionApp image later, upload it and tell me the filename and I'll add it to the portfolio.

Notes:
- Prefer a landscape/thumbnail image around 800x400 or similar for best visual results.
- After you add `spoton.png`, the portfolio will automatically show the image on the SpotOn card.
